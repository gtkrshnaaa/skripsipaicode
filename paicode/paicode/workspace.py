workspace.py
------------
This module acts as the workspace controller for Pai Code. It centralizes
application-level operations on the project's workspace, such as reading,
writing, listing, tree visualization, moving, removing, creating files and
directories, as well as applying diff-aware modifications. In order to protect
the workspace, it enforces path-security policies (path normalization, root
verification, and deny-listing sensitive paths) before executing any action.

All functions defined in this module are the provided primitives to manipulate
and manage files within the project workspace in a controlled, secure manner.
All operations are constrained strictly within the project root determined at
runtime (workspace scope), ensuring controlled manipulation of project files.
